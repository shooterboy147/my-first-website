      <h2>My Crypto Journey</h2>
      <p>It wasn't until around 2019, when I was finishing secondary school, that I started hearing crypto-related terms more often. I became more familiar, but I still didn’t act on it.</p>
      <p>In 2023, I began following some crypto accounts on Twitter. I didn’t understand them — just charts and numbers. It was overwhelming. Then in early 2024, I came across a tweet from <strong>Shola</strong> offering free crypto education through his Telegram group <strong>CryptoWithShola</strong>.</p>
      <p>That group changed everything. I learned how to trade, how to use signals, and how to read charts. I wasn’t perfect — I was still busy and didn’t practice enough. Eventually, I got <strong>liquidated</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong>My biggest lesson:</strong> Don’t trade with emotions. After losing money, I panicked and tried to recover it instantly — and lost even more. I learned to be patient, to think clearly, and to analyze before jumping back in.</p>
      <p>I created <strong>Bitcoin Secure</strong> to help others like me — people who are hungry to learn, grow, and win. I want to build a platform that motivates people, connects like-minded individuals, and shows we can win legally through knowledge and smart strategy.</p>
      <p>This is for anyone out there chasing a dream. You’re not alone.</p>
